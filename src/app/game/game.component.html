        <!-- https://angular.io/guide/displaying-data#showing-an-array-property-with-ngfor 
             This code snippet uses Angular's ngFor directive to loop through an array of five numbers [0,1,2,3,4].
             It also uses the ngStyle binding to apply a style dynamically to each image element, specifically adjusting
             the right margin of the element by i*5 pixels, where i is the current index of the loop iteration.
             The src attribute of the image element points to the location of a card cover image file in the project's
             assets folder.
